# **Angular \- Task Management Application**

## **Guidelines**

Use Angular to build a simple task management application with tests that meets the requirements along with a README.We expect you to complete this exercise in a maximum of 2 hours. Focus on core functionality rather than extensive styling or extra features. . If you're spending longer than that you are probably over-engineering the solution. 

**Requirements:**

* Display and manage a list of tasks with different priority levels  
* Allow creating new tasks and marking tasks as complete  
* Implement basic filtering by priority

## **An example test scenario**

When a user adds a task with High priority and then filters by High priority Then only High priority tasks will be visible in the list And the user will see a visual indication that a filter is currently applied: When a user adds a "High" priority task called "Submit report" Then the task appears in the task list And when the user filters by "High" priority, only high priority tasks are visible

## **What we're looking for:**

* A concise and considered README that provides instructions and communicates your assumptions, design decisions and trade-offs. No novels please\!  
* Tests with good coverage of the app's behavior that act as documentation for the code and includes the above example test scenario  
* Core functionality working as described  
* A simple and extensible technical design that is maintainable and easily understandable by other engineers  
* Code fluency and an idiomatic approach in Angular (TypeScript)

## 

## **What we're not looking for:**

You don't need to create a sophisticated UI or implement advanced features. To help you focus on what we're interested in, don't spend time on:

* Fancy styling or UI components  
* Backend implementation  
* User authentication  
* Persistence beyond what's outlined  
* Deployment configuration  
* Features not specified in the requirements

## **Starting Data**

Begin with 5-7 sample tasks in your initial data.

**Code Quality**

* Follow Angular best practices and style guidelines  
* Include comments where necessary for any complex logic  
* Create a clean, responsive UI (basic styling is sufficient)

## **Submission Instructions**

1. Create a new Angular project  
2. Implement the required features  
3. Include a README with:  
   * Setup instructions  
   * Brief explanation of your component structure  
   * Any assumptions or design decisions made  
   * List of completed requirements and bonus features  
4. Push your code to a public GitHub repository  
5. Submit the repository link by email

**Good luck\!**
